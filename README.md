About
=====

This is just a repository used for testing some sampling techniques for Monte
Carlo simulations. Currently only tests 1D and 2D of the following:

 - Uniform
 - Random
 - Jittered

In the future, it would be nice to add:

 - Benchmarks
 - 3D tests
 - Multi-jittered
 - Sobol
 - Correlated multi-jittered
 - Larcher-Pillichshammer
